# NinjaSweeper

>This is a build upon an algorithm exercise from the Coding Dojo's web fundamental course & an ode to the classic Minesweeper game made with simple HTML, CSS, & Javascript. It is a work in progress, and can be refined, but I hope you enjoy evading the ninja's who seek to assasinate you as you dig through the bush.
