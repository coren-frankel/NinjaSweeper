# NinjaSweeper

>This is a build upon an algorithm exercise from the Coding Dojo's web fundamental course & an ode to the classic Minesweeper game made with simple HTML, CSS, & Javascript. It is a work in progress, and could be refined, but was a light build to commemorate completing the web fundamentals course before plunging into Python stack. Please enjoy evading the ninja's who seek to corner and assasinate you as you dig through the bush. Live Demo [_here_](https://coren-frankel.github.io/NinjaSweeper/)
