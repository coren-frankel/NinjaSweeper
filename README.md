# NinjaSweeper

>This is a build upon an algorithm exercise from the Coding Dojo's web fundamental course & an ode to the classic Minesweeper game made with vanilla HTML, CSS, & Javascript. Please enjoy evading the ninja's who seek to corner and assasinate you as you dig through the bush. 
>>Live Demo [_here_](https://coren-frankel.github.io/NinjaSweeper/)

>Things I'd like to add in the future:
* Animation of leaves or bush or ninja upon clicking on a ninja square
* Refactor to provide difficulty settings: Grid size change & ninja frequency change 
* Music?
* Conditionally rendered emojis to replicate OG Minesweeper "Sunglasses Guy"

>Recently Checked off the list:
+ Make flag/shuriken function a toggle, so user can remove a shuriken if needed
+ Render squares with no adjacent ninjas blank
+ Upon losing the game, reveal all ninjas
+ Clicking on a non-ninja-adjacent square recursively clears all adjacents
+ Render the shuriken "flagged" squares unclickable while the shuriken is there
* Sounds? 
+ Make Owen Wilson say "wow" everytime the user highlights my name!
* Build in a tutorial for minesweeper-challenged folk
- Show qty of ninjas (consider shuriken countdown--subtract shuriken from total ninjas? classic?) - Show qty blank spaces left 
* Favicon!!!
